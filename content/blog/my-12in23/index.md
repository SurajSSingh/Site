This post will go over my experience with the Exercism #12-in-23 Challenge and what will happen next.
Much of this will be a retrospective of what I remember feeling for each language rather than a walkthrough of my solutions.

## Prior experience with Exercism

Before I get into my thoughts through each of the months in the challenge, a bit of background of myself.
I joined towards the beginning of 2022, as I was look for some ways to help my students practice programming in Python.
At the time, I think we would work through some problems together to get a feel for how Python works.

On my own time, I did some exercises in the C# and F# tracks.
C# mostly came from refreshing my knowledge for Unity and F# to compare it to a functional programming language.
The F# exercises transitioned into some Haskell, as one of my Master's course used Haskell ([CS 421 - Programming Languages & Compilers](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs421)).

However, after that, I didn't really have much time to work on the exercise (mostly due to my coding instructor work ramping up and finishing up my Master's degree).

## 12-in-23

In 2023, I had just graduated.

One extra challenge I set for myself was trying to do all the coding inside the Exercism web editor.
This was more so to try out each of the languages to see {}.
However, for those trying it, I would at least advise you to work it out in a dedicated editor {}.

### January
I did not do much for January since I didn't realize #12-in-23 had started, so I didn't official start until February. 
However, I did a finish a couple of unfinished Haskell exercises and looked into Python for mentoring.
Besides that, I mostly {}.

### Functional February
For February, I worked on the [Elixir track](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir) and finished 9 exercises. 

The concept I had the hardest time grasping was `atoms`, mostly since I had experience with the other concepts from other languages.
The main thing I got tripped up on {}.

I really liked Elixir as a language.

### Mechanical March
For the March theme, I focused on Rust track.
I had some small experience with Rust during my graduate program, specifically with implementing algorithms for my Data Mining course work.
However, I wanted to learn .

For this month, I had a mix of functional programming with some imperative code, which Rust excels at.

The hardest problem for me was the [Simple Linked List](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/simple-linked-list) exercise.
Mostly that was done to how I needed to conceptualize the `Box` type and the interaction between the `SimpleLinkedList` and `Node`.

Like others have already said, Rust is an awesome language to work in.
Even without help from an IDE, Rust was fairly simple to work in, at least for getting the basics down.
The compiler also provided .

### Analytical April
For April, I did the Julia track.
I mostly chose this since I already had some experience in Python and R, and wanted to learn something new.

I found the idea of Unicode operators {}.



### Mindshift May
For the month of May, I worked on the Prolog track.
I made this choice mostly to learn about a different declarative paradigm from function programming.

Working with Prolog was fairly strange, as I had to unlearn my imperative way of thinking.
For example, 

The biggest hurdle for me was the cut operator {}.

However, this month was one of the most rewarding.
It was the only time in this challenge where I physically woke up to write a solution.

### Summer of Sexp (June)
For June, I focused on the Clojure track.

I also worked on implementing MAL, which is Clojure inspired.

### Jurassic July
For July, I worked through the C track exercises.
I only knew C from what I remember from the introduction to C++, so I initially was hesitant to {}.
However, surprisingly, I found working in C to be really simple once you get the major concepts down.

It was also interesting to note that: 1) `bool` type is not built-in, but 2) C actually pointed out that I should include `<bool>`.

This month, I also finished Haskell.

### App August
For August, I worked through the Elm track.

Just like Rust, I liked the helpful compiler.

### Slim-line September
For September, I worked on the Raku track.

The hardest part for Raku was figuring out how to work with strings.
Surprisingly, the regex wasn't that bad.

### Object-Oriented October
For October, I focused on Ruby.
I had already had some experience with Java and C#.

### Nibby November
For November, I worked on the WASM track.
The main reason I chose this was to get an idea for working with Wasm from other languages like Rust or TypeScript.

I felt it much like C, simple once you got the major concepts down.

Also, this was the first time I posted in the Exercism Discord.


### December
For December, I worked through the Wren track.
The big reason I wanted to try Wren was to compare it to Lua.


### Overview
Gave a good focus for what to do.

2023 is the year of practicing Rust.

## What's next

### Comp Lang Comp
In late 2022, I started work on a website to compare a bunch of programming/computer languages syntaxes against each other.
The key think I wanted to do for this was provide links to resources for learning about the syntaxes.

I still plan to continue working on this.
The main thing I want to do before getting contributions for others is update the website to make it easier to work with.

### #48-in-24

Every Tuesday starting on January 16, 2024, new exercise will release.
Don't know the full plan, but I will be doing some blog post for (some of) these exercises.
