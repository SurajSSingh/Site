This post will go over my experience with the Exercism #12-in-23 Challenge and what will happen next.

## Prior experience with Exercism

Before I get into my thoughts through each of the months in the challenge, a bit of background of myself.
I joined towards the beginning of 2022, as I was look for some ways to help my students practice programming in Python.
At the time, I think we would work through some problems together to get a feel for how Python works.

On my own time, I did some exercises in the C# and F# tracks.
C# mostly came from refreshing my knowledge for Unity and F# to compare it to a functional programming language.
The F# exercises transitioned into some Haskell, as one of my Master's course used Haskell ([CS 421 - Programming Languages & Compilers](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs421)).

However, after that, I didn't really have much time to work on the exercise (mostly due to my coding instructor work ramping up and finishing up my Master's degree).

## 12-in-23

In 2023, I had just graduated.

One extra challenge I set for myself was trying to do all the coding inside the Exercism web editor.

### January
I did not do much for January since I didn't realize #12-in-23 had started. 
However, I did a finish a couple of unfinished Haskell exercises and looked into Python for mentoring.
But, I didn't official start until February.

### Functional February
For February, I worked on the [Elixir track](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir).

### Mechanical March
I focused on Rust track.

I had some small experience with Rust during my graduate program, specifically with implementing algorithms for my Data Mining course work.


Like others have already said, Rust is an awesome language to work in.

### Analytical April
Did the Julia track.

### Mindshift May
I worked on the Prolog track.
One of the few times I actually woke up to write a solution.

### Summer of Sexp (June)
Clojure track.

### Jurassic July
C track.
Surprisingly, really simple.

It was also interesting to note that: 1) `bool` type is not built-in, but 2) C actually pointed out that I should include `<bool>`.

This month, I also finished Haskell.

### App August
Elm

### Slim-line September
Raku

### Object-Oriented October
Ruby

### Nibby November
WASM.
Very much like C.

Also, the first time posting in the Exercism Discord.

### December
Wren.

### Overview
Gave a good focus for what to do.

2023 is the year of practicing Rust.

## What's next



### #48-in-24

Every Tuesday starting on January 16, 2024, new exercise will release.
Don't know the full plan, but I will be doing some blog post for (some of) these exercises.
