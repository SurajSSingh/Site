This example tries to keep the algorithm simple without any deeper mathematical proof required.\nWhat do I want to do?\nThe main problem here is that the function has to hold all numbers before marking them off. \nThis is especially bad for very large numbers as most numbers at that scale are composite.\nWe know that at minimum, half the numbers will not be prime (as they are even and thus divisible by 2).\nThis can be managed by using a segmented variant of the sieve, which builds the list in pieces.\nAnother issue is the need to process all the numbers first before they can be used.\nHowever, Python provides generators to allow yielding values while they are being generated, allowing one to stream the numbers in and process them immediately.\nBy using generators, the function only needs to process data as it is generated, allowing for early stopping.\nWith this, I will endeavor to create a better kind of sieve that can mark off items while being generated.\nThe idea should be to iteratively create a generator whose value will always return a prime when calling next on it (at least up to a point).\nThe primary metric to compare this solution to the Sieve of Eratosthenes is compactness (i.e. how much less memory is needed for the solution).\nMotivation\nSo, how did I come to think about this idea?\nWell, I was working on the Sieve exercise for Rust on Exercism. \nIn my first iteration, I didn’t fully read the instructions correctly and implemented it as an iterator that calculates prime numbers by modding each current number with all previously found primes and checking if all are not 0 (evenly divisible).\nWhen I went to redo the question for the second iteration, I used the step_by function to skip over multiples of a given value.\nSince the step_by function itself is iterable, it gave me an idea to see if I could chain a bunch of step_by functions together and yield primes that way.\nIf you see my second iteration for the solution, I did not implement that, but it did provide a seed for starting to think about such a solution.\nCurrent Idea\nThe idea for this new sieve is to start with a range of natural numbers stepping by 1 and somehow remove factors of a given prime by skipping over them to produce a next new range. At each successive step, the range is refined to only include primes and composites that don't hold any previous primes as factors. \nAs an example, let's start with all the Natural numbers, which will be our first range (range_0). \n$$\\mathbb{N} = range_0 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...]$$\nTo begin the algorithm, we will remove $0$ and $1$. \nThis means skipping the first two numbers and then continuing with the remaining range, which will yield the second range (range_1).\n$$range_0.skip(2) = range_1 = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...]$$\nThen, we start the algorithm proper.\nIn the beginning, we take the first number as prime and then somehow remove all its multiples.\nIn this case it's $2$ (which is the first prime) and to get rid of any multiple of $2$, we skip over them.\nFor $2$, we just need to skip every other number after $2$ (i.e. keep next, skip after). \nThe result will look something like this (range_2).\n$$range_1.skip(1).keeper(cycle([1])) = range_2 = [3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21...]$$\n2 Notes:\n\nI assume that we already take the first value out before the skip function runs. Otherwise, we would lose the prime after we just calculated it in the range. This means the range just holds what remains to be calculated, not the entire prime list. This is fine, since our function is a generator, and will yield the first value out.\nThe keeper function works by taking a pattern of items to keep and skipping over when the keep pattern changes. This is why cycle([1]) is needed, as we need to keep 1 number, then skip over the next, and then repeat this for the entire range.\n\nNow we loop back to the beginning step. \nWe take the first number as prime, which is $3$, and get rid of its multiples.\nBut, notice that some multiples of $3$ were removed in the previous step, namely all even multiples (divisible by $2$, the prior prime).\nThis means we need to skip all multiples of $3$ that are not multiples of $2$.\nFortunately, removing the evens did not change the number we need to skip by.\nAll multiples of $3$ are separated by 3 in range_1 and also separated by 3 in range_2.\nFor example, every multiple 3 in the full range is separated by 3 (should be obvious, since it is a multiple of 3).\nWhen we remove the even numbers, all multiples are now separated by 6 (e.g. 3 -&gt; 9, 9 -&gt; 15, 15 -&gt; 21, etc.).\nHowever, removing even numbers also removes half the numbers between the multiples, so 6 becomes 3.\nThus, we need just need to repeatedly keep every 2 numbers and skip once to produce the next range (range_3). \n$$range_2.skip(1).keeper(cycle([2])) = range_3 = [5,7,11,13,17,19,23,25,29,31,...]$$\nLet's do one more run through the loop (this one is a bit more interesting).\nThe next first number is $5$ and now we need to get rid of all multiples of $5$ not divisible by $2$ and $3$.\nLet's consider what those numbers are: \n$$[5,25,35,55,65,85,95, ...]$$.\nThe numbers appear to follow a [+20, +10, +20, +10, ...] cyclic pattern.\nNot only that, but the remaining numbers in-between also appear to follow a similar cyclic pattern: \n$$[\\textbf{5},7,11,13,17,19,23,\\textbf{25},29,31,\\textbf{35},37,41,43,47,49,53,\\textbf{55},59,61,\\textbf{65},...]$$.\nThis pattern is: [keep 6, skip 1, keep 2, skip 1] repeated forever (to my current knowledge).\nThis produces the final range we will look at range_4.\n$$range_3.skip(1).keeper(cycle([6,2])) = range_4 = [7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47...]$$\nThis calculation states to skip the first number ($5$), then keep the next 6 numbers (i.e. $7,11,13,17,19,23$), skip the next number ($25$), then keep 2 more numbers (i.e. $29, 31$), skip 1 ($35$), and then repeat the keep 6, skip 1, keep 2, skip 1 step.\nWe would keep running this until the largest prime up to some final number is found or after we stop yielding more value.\nNoticed Properties\nOne thing to notice is that during the processing of the range, all numbers between the first prime p and its square p^2 are prime. \nThis should make sense as any composite number with factors below p would have been removed in previous steps, and the first composite must be some multiple of p that does not share any factor in common with any primes below. \nThe first number that satisfies that is p^2.\nThis can help improve the stopping condition, since if we know the final number to generate, we can stop processing once we have a prime at least as large as the final number. \nAnother thing to notice is that skipping will not always be consistently the same number, as seen with range_4 using $5$ to calculate. \nI don't know if there is a specific name in mathematics for this concept, but the idea is similar to a step_by function which can dynamically change.\nTo allow for this, I use a helper function to allow cyclically keeping a set of values and then skipping one next value.\nAs for the pattern, finding what list of keeps and skips satisfies the range mathematically is a bit outside my scope of knowledge.\nInstead, one way to find the pattern would be to calculate how many numbers are in-between two (remaining) multiples and look for when this pattern of gaps repeats.\nAlthough this requires copying the currently running generator to retrieve those values and waiting until the pattern repeats (which can be very wasteful), this is the current approach I took for my coding attempts. \nI hope to eventually use what I learn from the attempts to find the pattern either empirically with some function or mathematically with a formula.\nExample Code\nGiven some BIG_NUMBER, I want to find all the primes up to that big number and yield the values as they are found. \nThe function for this should be a generator to be used like so:\n1for prime in prime_generating_sieve(BIG_NUMBER):\n2    print(prime)\n3\n4# prints out: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...\n\nThis can allow efficient stopping before reaching the end:\n1for prime in prime_generating_sieve(BIG_NUMBER):\n2    if prime &lt; 10:\n3        print(prime)\n4    else:\n5        break\n6\n7# prints out: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nIt can also be possible to resume the iterator at a later time:\n1prime_generator = prime_generating_sieve(BIG_NUMBER)\n2\n3# Previous prime needed as we need to call next on generator \n4# before we can check the value, which consume it in the iterator.\n5# Might be better if we could peek the value before consuming it.\n6previous_prime = None\n7\n8for prime in prime_generator:\n9    if prime &lt; 10:\n10        print(prime)\n11    else:\n12        previous_prime = prime\n13        break\n14# prints out: 2, 3, 5, 7\n15# previous prime become 11\n16\n17if previous_prime is not None:\n18    print(previous_prime)\n19    previous_prime = None\n20\n21# ...\n22# Continue from where we left off\n23\n24for next_prime in prime_generator:\n25    if prime &lt;

The PrimePages’ FAQ on whether negative numbers can be prime provides more information on this.\n\n","id":"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-0/","title":"Part 0: Background and Intro"},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-1/":{"body":"In this post, I will go over some of my attempts to implement a better version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\nIf you would like to read up on the background information for this topic, please see Part 0.\n\n    \n    TL;DR Summary\n    \n    \n    I have an idea to take a range generator and try to yield only prime numbers by figuring out a pattern to skip each multiple of the prime. The hard part is to somehow skip when previous skips are already applied (for example, when skipping multiples of 3, we don't need to consider 6, since we skipped it at 2). I then document 2 attempts at a solution, each of which works for small numbers, but fails at 1331 and 1573. I come to realize that I need to figure out how to find the pattern more mathematically.\n\n    \nSimple Generator Version\nTo set a baseline, I created a simple generator version adapted from my first iteration of the Sieve exercise for Rust on Exercism.\n1def sieve_generator(end: int = 100):\n2    # List of primes currently found\n3    currently_found_primes = []\n4\n5    # For every number from 2 up to the end number\n6    for number in range(2, end):\n7\n8        # Note: (number % prime) when converted to boolean\n9        #       means the same as (number % prime) != 0\n10        \n11        # If for every prime in currently found primes, number % prime != 0...\n12        if all((number % prime for prime in currently_found_primes)):\n13            # Append it to currently found primes list,\n14            currently_found_primes.append(number)\n15            # and yield the number.\n16            yield number\n17\n18    # Once finished, return the the list of found primes.\n19    # As this is a generator, this list is the value assigned\n20    # to the StopIteration exception\n21    return currently_found_primes\n\nThe goal for my attempts is to be as efficient and accurate as this.\nNote 1: This is meant to be the minimal standard version. Improvements can easily be made to this function.\nNote 2: This is a generator that also returns a value. One can either take primes as they are generated or wait until the StopIteration exception is raised to get the fully formed list.\nIdea Summary\nThe main idea, as described in part 0, is to take a range object and refine it with a pattern of skips to get all prime numbers out.\nBoth Python and Rust have lazy ranges, meaning the values inside the range are not held in memory, rather they are only produced when they are requested upon.\nRanges can be modified with skip and step-by functions to automatically jump over certain values.\nAll of this combined could help build a better generator function, as it would only need to hold the current range it is working on and yield from there.\nHowever, this only works if the pattern of skips, or rather pattern of keeping values, is tailored to each successive range so that it produces the appropriate value.\nIn this case, producing only values that are not a multiple of the prime being looked at.\nSetup\nImports\n1from collections import Counter, deque\n2from itertools import count, takewhile, tee\n3from more_itertools import peekable\n\n\ncollections from the standard library:\n\nCounter: Used to hold a count of numbers.\ndeque: Used for a queue data structure. \n\n\nitertools from the standard library:\n\ncount: Used to emulate an infinite range().\ntakewhile: Keep taking from an iterator while some condition is true.\ntee: Used to make a copy of an iterator.\n\n\nmore_itertools library:\n\npeekable: Allow one item look-ahead for a generator/iterator.\n\n\n\nHelper classes and functions\nBelow are a set of helper functions:\nA function that takes a generator and returns the first value and the remaining generator. Think of this as a combined head function and tail function starting at the first item from other languages like Haskell and R. I will use this to retrieve the first value while also skipping it in the generator (acts like skip()).\n1def generator_take_first(gen):\n2    try:\n3        return next(gen), gen\n4    except StopIteration:\n5        return None, gen\n\n\nA function that takes a generator and a list of how many indices to keep, and then yields that many values, skipping the next value when the pattern changes. This implements the keeper() function used above.\n\n1def generator_keep_then_skip_once(gen, keep_pattern = None):\n2    # Keep index when pattern is a list\n3    keep_index = None\n4    # If pattern is None or empty list, then keep everything\n5    if keep_pattern is None or keep_pattern == []:\n6        keep = 0\n7    elif isinstance(keep_pattern, int) and keep_pattern &gt;= 0:\n8        keep = keep_pattern\n9    elif isinstance(keep_pattern, list) and len(keep_pattern) &gt; 0:\n10        keep = keep_pattern\n11        keep_index = 0\n12    else:\n13        raise ValueError(f\"Expected a None, int, or list of ints for keep_pattern: got {keep_pattern}\")\n14    \n15    while True:\n16        try: \n17            keep_by = keep if keep_index is None else keep[keep_index]\n18            # Keep these value\n19            for _ in range(keep_by):\n20                yield next(gen)\n21            # Skip this one\n22            next(gen)\n23\n24            # Move to next item in pattern if pattern is a list\n25            # Cycle back around when it reaches the end\n26            if keep_index is not None:\n27                keep_index = (keep_index + 1) % len(keep)\n28            \n29        except StopIteration:\n30            break\n\n\nA function that takes a list and tries to find the shortest repeating pattern length. This is able to also handle partially defined patterns, for example: given $[2,4,5,2,4,5,2]$, it will determine that a length of 3 is enough to repeat, even though the last \"pattern\" is not fully defined. This does create an issue of how do we know if the pattern is correct (there might not be a pattern). This function does not address this, merely its goal is to find the shortest possible pattern which can satisfy if we assumed it repeated.\n\n1def shortest_periodic_pattern(list_with_pattern: list[int]) -&gt;

2:\n4    return []\n5\n6# Primes that have already been processed and whose multiples can never appear in the range\n7already_sieved_primes = [2]\n8\n9# Prime numbers that are between the current prime and its square.\n10#   To help find the keep pattern\n11helping_sieve_primes = deque([3])\n12\n13# The range that is running\n14#   Starts the unbounded range with 5 and step by 2: [5,7,9,...)\n15current_running_range = count(5,2)\n16\n17max_prime = helping_sieve_primes[-1]\n\nUpdate Loop\nWith the max prime value being initialized before the loop, I can update the while loop to be while max_prime &lt; final_number (i.e. conversion from a \"do-while\" to a regular \"while\" loop).\nThis update removes the max_prime check inside the loop.\nThen inside, I make a small update to the search for the number of primes.\nIn the attempt before, the loop would stop once it reaches the prime squared.\nI still do this, but I skip over the prime value squared to run one more loop. \n29# Count of how many numbers (all primes) are between p and p^2\n30while current_running_range.peek() &lt;= sieving_prime**2:\n31    # Skip the first composite number and stop the loop\n32    if current_running_range.peek() == sieving_prime**2:\n33        next(current_running_range)\n34        break\n35    # Count the next prime helper number\n36    helping_sieve_primes.append(next(current_running_range))\n\nOnce the prime square is skipped, I can also take the number up to the multiplication of the current prime (prime_0) and the next smallest prime (prime_1).\nThese numbers are also guaranteed to be prime because the next composite number is guaranteed to be the prime_0 * prime_1, since it is the combination of the two smallest distinct primes1.\nThis should provide more numbers to help with finding the pattern.\n38sieving_helper = helping_sieve_primes[0]\n39# While the next number is smaller than p*p+1, add the next number to helping list\n40while current_running_range.peek() &lt; sieving_prime*sieving_helper:\n41    # Count the next prime helper number\n42    helping_sieve_primes.append(next(current_running_range))\n\nBecause of the expanded list of helping primes, I updated the between list to include the current prime cubed (as the new final multiple). \n45between_list = sorted([sieving_prime, sieving_prime ** 2, sieving_prime**3] + [sieving_prime * p for p in helping_sieve_primes])\n\nThe for-loop after is kept the same.\nOnce all the numbers are found and tallied up, I find the shortest repeating pattern like before using the keep list, but with a small twist.\nFirst, the keep list does not exclude the first item anymore, as now two items are already accounted for in the pattern. \nInstead, once the pattern repetition is found, I have to move the beginning two numbers to the end.\nThis is because getting the prime before the current prime squared has already exhausted the range.\nSimilar for the primes up to current prime times next prime.\nIn order to keep the order correct, this means \"rotating\" the list to shift everything two units back and move the first two numbers to the end of the pattern.\n73# Skip first in list because already processed\n74keep_list = [between_counter[key] for key in sorted(between_counter.keys())]\n75\n76# Find the pattern\n77pattern_length = shortest_periodic_pattern(keep_list)\n78pattern = deque(keep_list[:pattern_length] if pattern_length &gt; 1 else keep_list)\n79pattern.rotate(-2)\n80pattern = list(pattern)\n\nOnce the pattern is determined, the current prime can be moved to the already processed list and the current range can be updated.\nSince the range has removed all numbers till the multiplication of the two lowest primes, I had to update the assertion.\n88# Remove prime_0 * prime_1 from the current range        \n89mult_of_lowest_two_primes, current_running_range = generator_take_first(current_running_range)\n90\n91# Verify that we have reached prime_0 * prime_1\n92assert mult_of_lowest_two_primes == sieving_prime * sieving_helper \n\nAfter the update, the while-loop should automatically stop once the number of primes reaches the final number (likely slightly faster since there are more numbers in the helper list).\nFull Code\n\n    \n    Attempt 2 Full Code\n    \n    \n    1def new_sieve_attempt_2(final_number:int = 1573) -&gt;

Unfortunately, that is note the case. The smallest counterexample for my created range is $5$: $5 * 11 = 55$ but $7^2 = 49$.\n\n","id":"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-1/","title":"Part 1: First Attempts"},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-2/":{"body":"In this post, I will go over what I learned throughout my research related to my sieving attempts.\nThink of this as an informal literature review for the sieve of Eratosthenes.\nWhat Does This Problem Ask\nBefore we continue, let's recall the goal of this problem.\nI want to generate prime numbers using ranges, which successively yield values directly from them.\nThis should be done without requiring one to store non-prime numbers or using modulus to figure out if the number is non-prime.\nOne way to do this would be to send a range through a sieve that removes multiples of already known prime numbers.\nFrom there, new sieves can be constructed using newly found prime numbers and eventually, all primes within some specified range will be found. \nIs this just a wheel factorization?\nNo... Yes... Maybe it might be, I am not sure right now.\nAt a cursory glance, the pattern might have something to do with wheel factorization.\nAs a quick review of wheel factorization as it pertains to sieves, it is an optimization to the sieve of Eratosthenes where one can reduce the set of numbers to check by using a small group of numbers (also known as the basis) to quickly find numbers that cannot be prime. \nAs an example, let's do the extremely simple basis of ${2, 3}$.\nHow might one skip any number divisible by $2$ or $3$, and do so in a cyclic way?\nSeparating that for $2$ and $3$, it would be to use every other number and skip every 3rd number respectively.\n$div2$ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...] \n$div3$ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...] \nIf one combines the two ranges, one get the following range:\n$div2AndDiv3$ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ...]\nWith this, one can spot that every \"6th\" number is where the cycle repeats, which should track since it is the multiple of both 2 and 3.\nAdditionally, one might notice that 1, 5, 7, and 11 in the range are not divisible by 2 or 3, so those might be candidates for prime numbers.\nWhat these numbers have in common is that they are co-prime to 6, that is, their only common divisor is 1.\nFrom here, one only needs to check 1/3 of the numbers from the full range, as numbers divisible by $2$ or $3$ have already been removed.\nMore numbers in the basis can further reduce the number of checks needed, though with diminishing returns.\nIn this problem's case, the pattern might have something to do with wheel factorization, though it's not that clear from the outset.\nHowever, besides that, I doubt there is anything else that is specific to the problem and wheel factorization, especially since wheel factorization is done at the beginning only once, whereas this problem focuses more creating new sieve (which could be wheels) from primes already found.\nI wonder if there is something that might use wheel factorization more dynamically.\nFinding the pattern\nBased on my current attempts to find the pattern, I will want to start by looking at the gap numbers.\nMore specifically, the numbers that remain between multiples of the prime I am working with.\nI have a feeling that could have something to do with the wheel factorization.\nIf I can figure out that, I could use the OEIS1 to find similar gap numbers and maybe even a formula.\nThat in turn could guide me as to how I could generate patterns without needing to calculate by going through a copy of the range.\nThe Code\nThe starting point to find the pattern is to first generate numbers and calculate the gaps.\nThe way I handled this was creating a simple function to count the numbers between two multiples of a given prime.\nThese numbers only exist if they were not multiples of any previous primes (though they may still be multiples of future primes).\nHere is the function I came up with:\ndef remaining_numbers_between_multiples(main_prime: int, prior_primes: list[int], final_number: int = 1000):\n    # Setup\n    counter = dict()\n    start_number = main_prime\n    current_count = 0\n\n    for n in range(main_prime+1, final_number+1):\n        # Not divisible by any prior primes\n        if all(map(lambda p: n % p, prior_primes)):\n            # Not divisible by the main prime\n            if n % main_prime:\n                current_count += 1\n            else:\n                # Save the count of numbers between start and n\n                counter[(start_number, n)] = current_count\n                # Reset count and start\n                current_count = 0\n                start_number = n\n\n    return counter\n\nAbove, I have a dictionary called counter which maps the key of the start and end tuple to the count value.\nChecking every number after the prime up to the final number, I skip over any numbers divisible by any prior primes, increment the counter if the number co-prime to the current prime, and finalize the counter range if the number is a multiple, which starts a new counter range.\nOnce that is done, I return the counter.\nSequences found\nAs a check to verify that this actually works as intended, I verified that $2$, $3$, and $5$ follow their already found patterns of skip every other number for $2$, skip after every two numbers for $3$, and the cyclic skip pattern of 6 and 2 for $5$.\nHere is the code:\n\n    \n    Validate 2, 3, and 5 pattern up to 100\n    \n    \n    print(remaining_numbers_between_multiples(2, [],

get two cycle runs.\nThese are a very long sequences, so I've compressed it to only include the list of number through first cycle without showing multiples.\nBelow is the GitHub Gist of my predictions for 7, 11, 13, and 17:\n\n    \n\nWith this, let's try to find these sequences.\nSequences on the OEIS\nHeading over to the OEIS, let's type these sequences in (or at least most of it).\nGetting the first sequence (prediction for 7), I got one entry found: A236175.\nThis represents \"Prime gap pattern of compacting Eratosthenes sieve for prime(4) = 7\".\nSo now I know what this is called: \"the prime gap pattern compacting up to a specific prime\". \nThis entry also links to similar patterns for prime(5) = 11, prime(6) = 13, prime(7) = 17, prime(8) = 19, and prime(9) = 23.\nThese sequences match the predictions made for 11, 13, and 17; and so I would say finding the pattern was a success.\nWhile there is a formula for $ prime(4) = 7$, there is no simple calculation for it (i.e. not requiring calculating the primes first) nor does it generalize up to the other primes.\nAs an alternative, I wanted to see if there was a way to calculate it based on prior sequences (i.e. 2 → 3 → 5).\nI first look to see how the sequence cycle length grows for each next prime.\nUsing the length of the sequences found, I found the entry A005867, which does not have a specific name, but I will refer to this as the \"prime gap pattern length\" sequence.\nThis sequence starts with $[1, 1, 2, 8, 48, 480, 5760, ...]$ and is a fast-growing sequence.\nCalling number len on my sequences for the first 7 primes also get those numbers, which is great.\nWhat's not great is how big those numbers are, as that means I need to have a giant list of numbers to find a pattern, which negates the efficiency of generating the number.\nGiven this revelation, I'm probably going to need to rethink how I generate the pattern, especially since I can't just store all the numbers when I want to create the skip pattern.\nSome other sieves\nOn the other side of my research is looking for similar sieves to what I am trying to achieve.\nAt a minimum, there appears to be 5 other sieves that generate primes, based on the Wikipedia page for the sieve of Eratosthenes.\nThese are:\n\nWheel Factorization: Covered in the prior section of this post.\nSieve of Atkin\nSieve of Sundaram\nEuler's Sieve: Found towards the bottom of the Sieve of Eratosthenes article\nSieve of Pritchard\n\nI will go over each of them and determine how closely they map to this problem.\nSieve of Atkin\nDiscovered by A. O. L. Atkin and Daniel J. Bernstein in 2003.\nThe sieve of Atkin is a variant of the sieve of Eratosthenes that attempts to optimize it by checking that candidate primes are: \n\nnot divisible by 2, 3, or 5; \nhave an odd number of solutions to one of three specific equations based on its remainder modulo 60; \nand is square-free, that being numbers that are not divisible by any square number other than 1. \n\nWhile theoretically better, the sieve of Atkin only really achieves an advantage when the number of primes to calculate is very high.\nFor this problem, the primary idea of note is the idea of square-free numbers.\nMy attempts did not account for determining if a number was a multiple of a square, which let slip through some numbers that should not have been there.\nFor more detail on this sieve, see the original paper by Atkin and Bernstein, Sieve Of Atkin post on Fylux Things ,and this Medium post on Sieve of Atkin by Clay Wrentz.\nSieve of Sundaram\nDiscovered by S.P. Sundaram in 1934.\nThe sieve of Sundaram is another variation on the sieve of Eratosthenes that has a different kind of elimination pattern.\nGiven a range from $1$ to $N$, $N$ being the final number, remove all numbers of the form $ a + b + 2ab $ where $ a $ and $ b $ are natural numbers with $ a \\le b $.\nOnce all numbers of that form up to $ N $ are removed, multiply each remaining number by $2$ and add $1$, giving all the odd prime numbers.\nAdd on $2$ to the beginning of the list and one has the prime numbers up to $N$.\nUnlike the sieve of Atkin, the sieve of Sundaram works better than the sieve of Eratosthenes when calculating a smaller range of primes, though become slower for higher range.\nFor further detail on this sieve, see this article on Sundaram's Sieve by Julian Havil and the Art of Problem Solving page on this sieve.\nSieve of Pritchard and Euler's Sieve\nSieve of Pritchard discovered by Paul Pritchard in 1979.\nEuler's Sieve originally used for Euler's proof of the Zeta Product formula, rediscovered by Gries &amp; Misra in 1978.\nWe now come to the final two sieves, and I've saved the best for last.\nThese two sieves are the closest to my idea of how the sieve is to work and how they work are quite interesting.\nI'll be giving them their own separate post to go into more details about how the algorithm works, however, in this post, I will lay out the general idea of the sieves.\nLet's start with the sieve of Pritchard, also known as (dynamic) wheel sieve (this seems familiar).\nThe idea is to generate prime numbers by constructing larger wheels at each step in the process to help skip over non-primes that have already been considered. \nA good analogy for this comes from the geometric view of this algorithm.\nCreate a wheel (w1) that has some marks and a circumference and let p be the current \"prime\" (prime in quotes since this does start at $1$).\nAt the start, p is set to 1, and the wheel's circumference is 1 and the only number in marks is at position 1.\nThen, one needs to generate the next wheel with this process:\n\n\"unroll\" the wheel to find the next value p,\n\nNote: the first two iterations unroll the wheel twice. This is because the wheel circumference is the same as p, and without doing it twice, would only produce values up to p (but not after).\n\n\nconstruct a new wheel (w2) whose circumference is p times w1's circumference,\nroll the wheel w1 inside w2, creating a new mark for w2 at the position where a mark in w1 touch w2,\nfinally, expand the wheel w1 (i.e. multiply it) by p and remove any marks in common between w1 and w2.\n\nAfter this, one just needs to keep constructing new larger wheels until reaching the ending number $N$ (or more optimally, the square root of $N$).\nThe Euler's sieve is a modification of the sieve of Eratosthenes which works to only mark off numbers onces.\nThe way this is accomplished is by multiplying whatever the currently first prime is with every number currently in the list (i.e. not marked off) and then removing those numbers in the list, thus removing every multiple of the prime (including itself).\nIf one keeps track of all the first numbers, this gives one all the primes.\nThe sieve is effectively the fully working and correct version of my pattern generating skip list, as it includes all multiples for a given prime during each step.\nThese two sieves actually relate to each other in a specific way: when the final wheel is constructed for the sieve of Pritchard, all remaining operations are equivalent to running Euler's sieve.\nWhy is that?\nThat leads to my Eureka moment with this problem.\nMy Eureka moment\nConsider one wheel of the sieve of Pritchard.\nOne knows by wheel factorization that the marks should only be numbers that are co-prime to the circumference of the wheel.\nRecall that the circumference of the wheel is the product of all the primes found until p.\nIf one rolls the wheel along the number line starting at 1, this will get all numbers co-prime to every prime before p.\nNow, what happens if one were to multiply that wheel by p and it rolled along the number line.\nThis gives one every multiple of p that was not removed in the prior wheels.\nIf for each p, the wheel rolls the number line, this will remove all multiple of p.\nDoing this is effectively the same as each step of the Euler's sieve in which p is the first number.\nThis correspondence between the wheel and the number line finally illustrates how the prime gap pattern is created and why it cycles.\nLet's do $5$ as an example.\nThe cyclic gap pattern is: $[6,2]$.\nOne might wonder why it is those numbers.\nLet's take a look at the wheel for $5$:\n$[1,7,11,13,14,17,19,23,29]$.\nIf one adds back $5$ and $25$ (found by multiplying the previous wheel $3$ by $5$: $ [5•1, 5•5] $), one gets: $[1,\\textbf{5},7,11,13,17,19,23,\\textbf{25},29]$. \nCounting the numbers between them (assuming a cyclic list), one will see that it follows the $[6,2]$ patterns (technically $[1,6,1]$, but since it is cyclic, the first and last numbers are combine).\nWith this understanding, I have a better idea of how the skip pattern is created and why those numbers are kept in the range.\nIdeas for Next Attempts\nSo with all that I have learned, what's the next step?\nFirst, I will likely use the sieve of Pritchard and Euler sieve as the new baseline, as those two sieve are the closest to what the sieve I have in mind.\nI will also need to update how the pattern is found and stored, since I can't really have a giant list for the skip pattern (otherwise, why not just use the sieve of Eratosthenes).\nAs a possible idea, I could see if there is a way to dynamically generate the wheel through a different pattern while it is used to dynamically skip the range.\nFootnotes\n1\nOn-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, a useful tool to see if some sequence of numbers have already been cataloged, can be used to find formulas or

back"},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/intro-reinforcement-learning/":{"body":"This blog post will go over a simple high level introduction to reinforcement learning. \nI will focus on providing some major terms and explaining the common ideas for any reinforcement learning setup.\nMy goal is to provide a good jumping off point for further research. \nAlso, this is meant to be language and software agnostic, but I will provide some resources for a couple of concrete implementations towards the end of the post. \nWhat is Reinforcement Learning?\n\n    Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n    is a kind of machine learning strategy/paradigm where one trains an intelligent agent using a reward structure. \nThe agent makes decisions based on what it observes and takes actions based on what it believes will maximize the total rewards.\n     \nNote: Despite the name \"rewards\", rewards can be either positive or negative. \nAgents under this learning system usually operate in a simulated environment where there are no exact actions that produce the best outcome but there is a predefined goal to reach. \nIt is up to the agent to figure out how best to accomplish the task using the rewards given during each training episode.\nComparison\nReinforcement learning can be contrasted with the other two main strategies of machine learning: Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1:  Table comparing reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning\n    \n    \n    Type of

ExamplePlaying video gamesSchool ExamsYoung child categorizing different animals\n\n\n    \n    \n\nNote: Despite the strategies being described separately, they are often used together. \nFor instance, a subclass of Reinforcement Learning is Behavior Imitation, in which the agent learns both the behavior to imitate (via Supervised Learning) and which actions the policy finds to be the best (via Reinforcement Learning)\nAnother instance is Semi-Supervised Learning, which brings together aspects of Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.\nOverview of Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning splits the world into two main parts. The first is the environment, which is essentially the abstract world of the simulation. \nThe environment is made up of many different states, which may or may not dynamically change by itself. \nThe environment is meant to be a simple and specific reconstruction of a more complex (real-world) system. \nThis reduction of the world space allows one to control what is important to learn and can speed up training, as there are fewer distractions inside the environment.\nThe second part is the agent, which is an entity that exists within the environment capable of making decisions. \nThe agent is able to take in information from the environment, interpret that to make a decision, then do something in/to the environment, and then get some sort of reward.\nThis builds the backbone of how the agent operates inside the environment and what it learns with this can be translated to more real world tasks.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Figure 2:  Image of the reinforcement learning loop (observe-act-reward) diagram.\n    \n\nLet's walk through the loop. \nThe loop start with the environment in some particular state. \nIn order for the agent to determine the state, it needs to observe the state, usually with some kind of sensor. \nThe observation becomes the input data to the decision maker and the decision maker outputs a decision based on a specific policy it follows. \nThe decision is translated to an action, often implement with actuators, that may or may not change the state of the environment. \nWhen an action is taken, there may also be a reward attached to the state change, which provides feedback to the agent. \nThe loop starts over again with the next state.\nThis loop runs every \"turn\" during an episode. An episode can be thought of as a single simulated run from start to end. \nDuring each training episode, the agent focuses on exploring the action space to see what yields the highest reward. \nThis allows the agent to get the widest set of data to work from when developing it's strategy. \nOn a testing episode, the agent will use the best-found strategy to solve the task. \nGenerally, the agent includes the sensors, decision maker, and actuators in a single entity, but it may be possible to split them apart into different entities (for example, Alpha Go is just the decision maker that was trained in a simulated environment, but it requires a camera to see the real-world game board and a human player to play it pieces). \nAlso, while any kind of artificial intelligence model may be used for reinforcement learning, there is currently a focus on using neural networks for the decision making process. \nThis form of reinforcement learning is called deep reinforcement learning.\nApplications\nThere are a variety of use cases for reinforcement learning. \nOne is autonomous vehicle navigation (or more simply self-driving capabilities). \nUsing cars as an example, different companies trained their vehicles to navigate a road environment, using sensors such as cameras and LIDAR system and actuators that allow pressing accelerator/gas pedal and controlling the steering wheels. \nAnother is Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as ChatGPT. \nThese models are trained on a vast corpus of human produced text and use reinforcement learning to produce more natural dialogue responses.\nOne other is social media recommendation engines, which try to learn habits of the user and try to provide the best content to serve. \nFor example, YouTube's algorithm (based on current anecdotal trends) prioritize watch time.\nIn order for an agent to get a reward, it will try to find the best video(s) to have the user watch and engage with, which increases the time spent on the site.\nResources\nBelow are some resources for developing, training, and using Reinforcement Learning agents. \nNote, I have primarily worked with RL agents using Python and Unity, so I am biased toward those technologies.\nIf you have any other resources to contribute, please let us all know in the comments section.\nFrameworks\n\nGymnasium(successor to

retrospective of what I remember feeling for each language rather than a walkthrough of my solutions, \nso expect a more stream of consciousness style of writing.\nPrior experience with Exercism\nBefore I get into my thoughts through each of the months in the challenge, a bit of background of myself.\nI joined towards the beginning of 2022, as I was looking for some ways to help my students practice programming in Python.\nAt the time, I think we would work through some problems together to get a feel for how Python works.\nOn my own time, I did some exercises in the C# and F# tracks.\nC# mostly came from refreshing my knowledge for Unity and F# to compare it to a functional programming language.\nThe F# exercises transitioned into some Haskell, as one of my Master's courses used Haskell (CS 421 - Programming Languages &amp; Compilers).\nHowever, after that, I didn't really have much time to work on the exercises (mostly due to my coding instructor work ramping up and finishing up my Master's degree).\n12in23 Challenge\nIn 2023, I had just graduated, and I was finishing up some student projects.\nI had some free time and wanted to learn more about programming languages.\nInitially, I tried to work on the Comp Lang Comp project, though I didn't have much motivation to continue due to other commitments.\nInstead, when I learned about the 12in23 Challenge by Exercism, I thought it would be a good way to get exposed to a bunch of languages.\nWhile there were only 12 themes for the year, so I couldn't deep dive into any one language, it would at least introduce a bunch of different paradigms for me to work through.\nOne extra challenge I set for myself was trying to do all the coding inside the Exercism web editor.\nThis was more so to try out each of the languages in its simplest form.\nThis way, it would require me to read the docs and take notes for how to code.\nIt did work for the docs, but I didn't actually have a note-taking system at the time, so that part fell by the wayside.\nJanuary\nI did not do much for January since I didn't realize #12in23 had started, so I didn't officially start until February. \nHowever, I did a finish a couple of unfinished Haskell exercises and looked into Python for mentoring.\nBesides that, there wasn't much I did for Exercism until February rolled around.\nFunctional February\nFor February, I worked on the Elixir track and finished 9 exercises. \nOriginally, I wanted to do Haskell, but I wanted to try out a [BEAM language], since I never really worked with one before.\nThis lead me to Elixir and Gleam.\nI eventually settled on Elixir, mostly down to wanting to check out the Phoenix framework (though I didn't actually have the time to create a project with it).\nI liked learning Elixir, especially with it simple syntax and being functional without being too overbearing with types.\nThe concept I had the hardest time grasping was atoms, mostly since I had never experienced it from other languages.\nThe main thing I got tripped up on was thinking of atoms as variable identifiers, rather than predefined constant.\nThe biggest thing I remember for this month was the Interview with Jose Valim.\nSome ideas brought up were some things I had already considered working through, such as having language cheat sheets and creating objects using regex.\nMechanical March\nFor the March theme, I focused on the Rust track.\nI had some small experience with Rust during my graduate program, specifically with implementing algorithms for my Data Mining course work.\nBeyond that, I wanted to learn more about Rust and thought working through some exercises would help with that.\nFor this month, I had a mix of functional programming with some procedural code, which Rust excels at.\nI really loved the way I could chain functions (usually through the Iterator trait), \nbut could always add small imperative elements like mutable variables to help build my solution.\nThe hardest problem for me was the Simple Linked List exercise.\nMostly that was down to how I needed to conceptualize the Box type and the interaction between the SimpleLinkedList and Node.\nLike you've probably heard from others, Rust is an awesome language to work in.\nEven without help from an IDE, Rust was fairly simple to work in, at least for getting the basics down.\nThe compiler also provided great help when I made some simple to fix mistake, and usually guided me towards a working solution.\nFor the remaining of 2023, I would continue working on and off in Rust for some projects.\nAnalytical April\nFor April, I did the Julia track.\nI mostly chose this since I already had some experience in Python and R, and wanted to compare Julia to it.\nFor the exercises, I mostly came at it from a Python based approach, which might bias my solutions towards that.\nHowever, with that, I found Julia to be a more compact Python.\nI especially liked the way lambdas are done in Julia over Python, since it is just an arrow -&gt; away instead of the word lambda.\nAlso, I found the idea of Unicode identifier to be really cool to add executable math equations, although I didn't have much of a chance to use that as much.\nMindshift May\nFor the month of May, I worked on the Prolog track.\nI made this choice mostly to learn about a different declarative paradigm from functional programming.\nWorking with Prolog was fairly strange at first, as I had to unlearn my imperative way of thinking.\nFor example, learning not to think in assigning variables directly, but having atoms bound to a value based on the logical relations.\nOnce I got my head around the concepts, things clicked into place form me.\nThe biggest hurdle for me was learning how to use the cut operator correctly.\nHowever, this month was one of the most rewarding.\nIt was the only time in this challenge where I woke up as I was drifting off to sleep to write1 a solution that popped into my mind.\nSummer of Sexp (June)\nFor June, I focused on the Clojure track.\nI hadn't worked with a LISP dialect before and none of them particularly called to me, \nso I just chose the one that had I had heard about the most.\nFor the most part, nothing seem to be too out of the ordinary for me besides the prefix function/operator application.\nLisp languages seemed fairly straightforward once you get past the unfamilarity of S-Expressions.\nFor this month, I also worked on implementing Make-A-Lisp in Rust, which is a Clojure inspired Lisp.\nThe synergy with this month gave me a better grasp of how Lisps work and some concepts related to language development.\nJurassic July\nFor July, I worked through the C track exercises.\nI only knew C from what I vaguely remember from my undergraduate introduction to C++, so I initially was hesitant with how the coding would go.\nHowever, surprisingly, I found working in C to be really simple once you get the major concepts down.\nIt was also interesting to note that: 1) bool type is not built-in, but 2) C actually pointed out that I should include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;.\nI guess I expected C to be more obtuse (though it could just be that I haven't programmed in a large C project).\nAlthough the language itself doesn't actually provide the safeguards of modern languages, I didn't really run into issues with out-of-bound or off by 1 errors (thanks Rust for baking the borrow checker into my brain, I guess). \nThis month, I also finished a bunch more Haskell exercises.\nAppy August\nFor August, I worked through the Elm track.\nThis was mostly down to trying out something I could use for web app development.\nConsidering what I learned from Elixir and Haskell, Elm's functional programming features felt really simple to grasp.\nJust like Rust, I liked the helpful compiler guiding me towards a working solution.\nWhile I did like working in Elm, I actually settled on Svelte for web development.\nThis was mostly since Svelte's HTML-focus templating felt more natural for me.\nHowever, I will say that Elm's ease of creating type-safe models and functions was much better than TypeScript.\nI also finished a few more exercises for Elixir this month.\nSlim-line September\nFor September, I worked on the Raku track.\nI was going between Perl and Raku, and what decided it for me was Raku's parsing tools.\nThe hardest part for Raku was figuring out how to work with strings.\nSurprisingly, the regex wasn't that bad, though that could just be how my brain works.\nI would have wanted to spend more time going through the Grammar tool (and especially the named regex to help me with a programming language I am considering creating).\nObject-Oriented October\nFor October, I focused on Ruby.\nI had already had some experience with Java and C#, and Ruby was the only popular object-oriented language I hadn't actually used before.\nRuby itself was a fairly easy language for me to pick up and nothing felt too out of the ordinary.\nTwo things that stood out for me were the native use of regex (which made string search really easy) and the concept of blocks (which felt very much like Rust's closures).\nNibbly November\nFor November, I worked on the WASM track.\nThe main reason I chose this was to get an idea for working with WebAssembly from other languages like Rust or TypeScript (via AssemblyScript).\nI felt it much like C, simple once you got the major concepts down.\nThe big thing I struggled with was trying to visualize thinking about strings.\nSince WebAssembly itself only has the concept of numbers, strings are just a series of bytes stored in memory.\nThe hard part was figuring out the way memory works in WebAssemby.\nThe rest would then be handled by a memory \"pointer\" (memory offset) and string length, just like C.\nSomething I did for this month was work on a visual debugger to help understand the stack-based processing.\nThis gave a better idea about how WebAssembly is implemented.\nAlso, this was the first time I posted in the Exercism Discord, \nwhere I listed some helpful resources for working directly in Wasm.\nOverall, it felt nice learning a lower level language and appreciating the affordances provided by higher level ones.\nDecember\nFor December, I worked through the Wren track.\nThe big reason I wanted to try Wren was to compare it to Lua.\nFor the most part, Wren felt very much like a traditional object-oriented programming language.\nNothing stood out too much, though that could be because I approach much of the problems from an imperative view.\nLooking at some other solutions, I saw that they were using block like Ruby, and had a more functional style,\nwhich I should have tried more of.\nWhat I learned from this challenge\nThere can be a lot to say about all that I learned throughout this challenge, here are my major takeaways:\n\nThe challenge gave me a focused point to learn a specific language in a good amount of time (enough to understand where to go next).\nI learned and practiced a specific paradigm by language.\nGave me some inspiration for projects for learning languages (Comp-Lang-Comp and WASVD). \n\nHere are some things I will try differently moving forward:\n\nTrying out other kinds of solutions in the same language (Exercism saves different iterations)\nPicking more obscure programming languages to help expand my thinking for programming languages\nBuild more projects that support the language I am working in\n\nWhat's next\nHere's what's next for me after the challenge.\nComp Lang Comp\nIn late 2022, I started working on a website to compare a bunch of programming/computer languages syntaxes against each other.\nThe key think I wanted to do for this was provide links to resources for learning about the syntaxes from primary sources.\nOriginally, I had planned to work on this during the challenge, but time slipped away from me, and I didn't really have time to contribute.\nHowever, with what I learned and some resources I have found, I still plan to continue working on this.\nThe main thing I want to do before opening it up to public contributions is updating the website to make it easier to work with.\nCurrently, it is a Slate website, which I mostly chose because it had the side by side code view.\nThe only issue was that I didn't really have a good grasp of Ruby to make changes on my own. \n#48in24 challenge\n#48in24 is the successor to the #12in23 challenge.\nEvery Tuesday starting on January 16, 2024, a new exercise will be highlighted.\nDon't know the full plan, but I will be doing some blog post for (some of) these exercises.\nFootnotes\n1\nBy \"write\", I mean make a voice memo, I didn't want to ruin my sleep by getting my laptop and coding something in the

This allows modifying the value of data (such as setting a new symbol-value pair) without requiring the environment itself be mutable.\nRc is for explicitly adding reference counting to an object, allowing multiple ownership. Used to allow holding multiple references for an environment when an environment is changed (such as let-bindings or function closures).\n\n\nVector pattern matching using slices\n\nThis removes the need for using a VecDequeue data type, as I no longer need to use the pop_front function to get the first item.\nI can do complex matching, such as on specific enum variants, which makes it much easier to process the meaning of the match (also reducing the number of if-statements needed to extract the values).\n\n\n\nWhat is next\nFinishing up the next set of steps from the guide.\nOnce that is done, I might work on implementing the ideas from the Readable Lisp S-expressions Project.\n","id":"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/1/","title":"Devlog 1: 2023-06-20"},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/2/":{"body":"What was accomplished\nFinished up all remaining steps from mal - Make a Lisp.\nStep 6\nIn this step, I worked on loading strings from a file, command line arguments, evaluating from within the implementation, and working on implementing atoms.\nMuch of the work on this step was simple enough.\nI did start thinking about adding additional items to the program.\nFor example, command line parsing with Clap and using Miette for error showing.\nHowever, initial refactoring took too much time, so I put that on hold for later work once I finished the guide.\nStep 7\nThis step focused on implementing quoting functionality.\nI was very confused about how to implement the quasiquote() function, even after looking at the Rust example. \nThe tests for quasiquote were not working. \nHowever, I learned I made a silly mistake where the code was not in the correct if-branch case. \nI also confused cons and concat in function, as well as unquote and splice, specifically forgetting to use them as special keywords rather than symbols.\nGoing through this process got me thinking that maybe making these special forms as separate variants wasn't a good idea. \nThe mix of symbols and special forms lead to much confusion about whether I was evaluating the correct form.\nI eventually got it all to work.\nStep 8\nFor step 8, I worked on implementing Lisp macros.\nI had some confusion with the macroexpand() function, mainly with how the macro continues after applying the first run-through.\nOnce I got my bearing with this and completed the function, the rest of the items in this step were simple to implement.\nI think I am beginning to feel comfortable programming in Rust.\nStep 9\nThis step focused on implementing try-catch.\nThis was fairly easy to accomplish using Rust's Result enum. \nI had the update the error case to add Exceptions and pass whatever value the user had.\nI did struggle a bit with the apply() function.\nThis is mostly down to my incorrect mental model of how the function is applied to each item.\nThe rest of the functionality was simple enough, though there was much more than before. \nThe hardest functionality to implement was the hash-map functions (namely assoc and dissoc), as I hadn't worked with them yet, and I implement the map as a vector of tuple pairs. \nAlso had to fix equality for hashmaps since the ordering does not matter. \nI'll consider changing over when adding immutable data structures.\nStep A\nThis final step was a catch-all for all other remaining items, such as reading a line from the user and more core functions.\nI spent way too much time trying to figure out why the step was failing when I added the *host-language* variable. \nTurns out, I missed quotes and ending parentheses.\nThat just emphasizes how much I need an error diagnostic system added to my implementation.\nOn the other side, adding metadata for functions and collection was tedious more than hard.\nAs well, I tried to get Rust evaluation working using the Evcxr crate but failed to get it working (the REPL would hang when evaluating Rust code).\nWhat I learned\nI got more comfortable working with Rust and learn about some external libraries that could help later on. \nSome of these include:\n\nEvcxr REPL: Rust REPL, to allow running Rust code from my REPL.\nMiette: Diagnostic library for more clearly showing where errors occur.\nCriterion: Benchmarking library which can be a good way to check that I am making efficient changes.\nIm: A library that provides immutable data structures just like Clojure. \nNum: A generic numeric type library that can make interacting with different types of numbers a bit better.\n\nWhat's next\nDo an initial refactor of what is created and make sure new improvements can easily be added.\nMake sure to benchmark the changes.\n","id":"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/2/","title":"Devlog 2: 2023-06-27"}},"docInfo":{"https://thetechtreeblog.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/about/":{"body":119,"title":1},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/":{"body":5,"title":1},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/":{"body":9,"title":2},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-0/":{"body":1335,"title":4},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-1/":{"body":2821,"title":4},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/better_sieve/part-2/":{"body":2050,"title":5},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/intro-reinforcement-learning/":{"body":642,"title":3},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/blog/my-12in23/":{"body":1180,"title":3},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/":{"body":11,"title":1},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/1/":{"body":516,"title":5},"https://thetechtreeblog.com/devlog/maltar/2/":{"body":362,"title":5}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
